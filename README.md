# DAWN-ICL: Strategic Planning of Problem-solving Trajectories for Zero-Shot In-Context Learning ï¼ˆNAACL 2025ï¼‰

## ðŸ˜€ Overview

+ We are the first to formalize ZS-ICL as a planning problem, which is closer to real-world scenarios.

+ We propose a novel demonstration-aware MCTS for ZS-ICL to achieve a more effective and efficient search for the problem-solving trajectories.

+ Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and it even outperforms ICL using human-annotated demonstrations.
